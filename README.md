A micro RPG for the Gameboy, developed for [GB Compo 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gbcompo23)!

## About the code

Please note that while I've done what I can to keep this project clean and performant, I'm not a Gameboy expert and there are likely various things that could be improved upon. Some parts of the code, namely those written towards the end of the jam, are sloppily done, but I like to think that most of the code is decent.
